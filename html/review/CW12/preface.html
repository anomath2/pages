An early motivation of studying Lie superalgebras as a generalization of Lie algebras came from supersymmetry in mathematical physics.
Ever since a Cartan-Killing type classification of finite-dimensional complex Lie superalgebras was obtained by Kac <a href="K77" class="cite">[K77]</a> in 1977, the theory of Lie superalgebras has established itself as a prominent subject in modern mathematics.
An independent classification of the finite-dimensional complex simple Lie superalgebras whose even subalgebras are reductive (called simple Lie superalgebras of classical type) was given by Scheunert, Nahm, and Rittenberg in <a href="SNR76" class="cite">[SNR76]</a>, <a href="SNR76a" class="cite">[SNR76a]</a>.
</div>
<div class="para">
The goal of this book is a systematic account of the structure and representation theory of finite-dimensional complex Lie superalgebras of classical type.
</div>
<div class="para">
The presentation in this book is organized around three dualities with a unifying theme of determining irreducible characters:
Schur duality, Howe duality, and super duality.
</div>
<div class="para">
There are two superalgebra generalizations of Schur duality. The first one, due to Sergeev and independently Berele-Regev <a href="BR87" class="cite">[BR87]</a>, is an interplay between the general linear Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ and the symmetric group, which incorporates the trivial and sign modules in a unified framework.
The second one, called Sergeev duality, is an interplay between the queer Lie superalgebra $\mathfrak{q}(n)$ and a twisted hyperoctahedral group algebra.
</div>
<div class="para">
Lie superalgebras allow an elegant and uniform treatment of Howe duality on the polynomial and exterior algebras.
The Howe dualities allow us to determine the character formulas for the irreducible modules appearing in the dualities.
</div>
<div class="para">
The third duality, super duality, has a completely different flavor.
It views the representation theories of Lie superalgebras and Lie algebras as two sides of the same coin, and it is an unexpected and rather powerful approach developed in the past few years by the authors and their collaborators, culminating in Cheng-Lam-Wang <a href="CLW11" class="cite">[CLW11]</a>.
