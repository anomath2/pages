  <li>
 The invention of quantum groups is one of the outstanding achievements of mathematical physics and mathematics in the late twentieth century.
  The birth of the new theory and its rapid developments are results of a strong interrelation between mathematics and physics.
  </li>
<li>
 Quantum groups arose in the work of L.\ D.\ Faddeev and the Leningrad school on the inverse scattering method in order to solve integrable models.
  </li>
<li>
 The algebra $U_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$ appeared first in 1981 in a paper by P.\ P.\ Kulish and N.\ Yu. Reshetikhin on the study of integrable XYZ models with highest spin.
  </li>
<li>
 A major event was the discovery by V.\ G.\ Drinfeld and M.\ Jimbo around 1985 of a class of Hopf algebras which can be considered as one-parameter deformations of universal enveloping algebras of semisimple complex Lie algebras.
  </li>
<li>
 Almost simultaneously, S.\ L.\ Woronowicz invented $SU_q(2)$ and developed his theory of compact quantum matrix groups.
  </li>
<li>
 An algebraic approach to quantized coordinate algebras was given about this time by Yu.\ I.\ Manin.
  </li>
<li>
 Quantum groups are related to
  <ul>
    <li>
 Lie groups and algebras, and their representation theory.
    </li>
<li>
 special functions.
    </li>
<li>
 knot theory.
    </li>
<li>
 low-dimensional topology.
    </li>
<li>
 operator algebras.
    </li>
<li>
 noncommutative geometry.
    </li>
<li>
 combinatorics.
    </li>
<li>
 quantum inverse scattering method.
    </li>
<li>
 integrable models.
    </li>
<li>
 elementary particle physics.
    </li>
<li>
 conformal and quantum field theories.
    </li>
<li>
 ``symmetry'' in physics.
  </li>
</ul>

  </li>
<li>
 There is no satisfactory general definition of a quantum group.
  It is commonly accepted that quantum groups are certain ``nice'' Hopf algebras.
  The quantized enveloping algebras and the quantized coordinate rings are guiding examples.
